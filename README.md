# Victoria-Road-Accidents- A Multilevel Model Analysis
Multi Level Modelling of Victoria Road Accidents Data

The previous analysis showed that the Vehicle's Make/Model and Number of years (i.e. how old the vehicle is) showed statistical significance.

This study dives deeper into the vehicle aspect of road accidents to answer the question of whether vehicleâ€™s make and model have an impact on the severity of road accidents or not.

I have used Multi Level Modelling to see if the severity of accidents are due to vehicle's types or models or not.

There are three scripts;
<ul>
<li>Script1- Data Wrangling.R</li>
<li>Script2- Exploratory Data Analysis.R</li>
<li>Script3- Modelling.R</li>
</ul>

The result shows that we cannot say that Make and Model are significant to determinie severity. On the other hand, older vehicles and higher speed zones have shown significance. 

The final report is "Multilevel Analysis of Road Accidents.pdf".
